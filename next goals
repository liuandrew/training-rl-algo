quantify how long they spend looking at the goal
or how long to get to goal after spotting

resulting behavior with different reward structure
    distribution of distance from goal with time (actual distribution as a function of time)
    at a given time step, average and standard deviation distance away from goal

    could be that one hangs around far away and then 


maybe look at percentage of trials where goal is not reached to see if training is better
    using the reward shaping

    also look at individual agents to see how much reaching the goal affects

make into section of preliminary results - in simple task and reward structure

covering more territory as auxiliary task or within episode curiosity
competition - 2 agents to get there faster

maybe also start to include colored walls to see if it can build representation of map


next also try invisible platform with red walls vs colored walls


1 document a little better differences between reward structures
2 0-1 reward structure with auxiliary task
3 hidden platform
4 update document with preliminary results to see if you want to revise aims
